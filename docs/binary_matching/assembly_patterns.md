# Assembly patterns (MSVC 8.0 / VS2008, x86, /Od + LTCG)

How recovered-assembly shapes map back to Vostok C++ source. Every agent in the
matching loop reads this first and **appends** to it whenever it recognizes a new
asm -> source mapping. This is the shared memory that makes each run faster than
the last. Keep entries short - one pattern each.

Baseline for these modules (`/Od`, no optimization, plus LTCG):
- every statement is emitted, in source order; no strength reduction or
  reordering.
- every local and parameter has a stack slot, addressed `ebp`-relative; standard
  `push ebp / mov ebp, esp` frame.
- LTCG / the linker can change how values cross a `call` boundary (which registers
  / how much stack) **and how the frame is laid out** (stack-slot assignment) - but
  it does not reorder the body. A body that is implementation-identical but differs
  only in register / `[ebp-XX]` stack-slot allocation is a **match** (see
  `MATCHING.md` - LTCG). Other linker effects exist and are not fully enumerated,
  so trust the operand-aware match % over a raw instruction-difference count.

## Entry format

```
### <short name>
ASM:
    <a few representative instructions>
SOURCE:
    <the C++ that produces it>
NOTES: <when it applies, the overload/intrinsic involved, gotchas>
```

## Patterns

### float literals 0.0f / 1.0f on the FPU
ASM:
    fldz            ; 0.0f
    fld1            ; 1.0f
SOURCE: a bare `0.0f` / `1.0f` literal used in an FPU expression.
NOTES: if your base instead does `movss xmm, [__real@...]` (constant pool load),
the source used a named constant / variable, not the bare literal. Observed in
`game_core/sources/bullet.cpp` (`squared_length( ) < 1.f` emitted `fld1`).

<!-- Append new patterns below. Prefer concrete asm + the exact C++ that
     reproduces it; cite the file/function where you confirmed it. -->
